For this reason, despite having the physical appearance of a twenty one year old adult male, Yasuaki has only actually been alive for two years. This in many ways explains his emotional simplicity and naivety, since he has not yet learnt many of the things his companions have grown up absorbing.",

Unlike his partners, a glance into his past and how Orochimaru recruited him was given, making him a far more dramatic character. The anime shows that he was an orphan living on the streets who hustled by stealing for a living, and was almost always beaten for it. Orochimaru had told him he had potential and liked the strength in his eyes. He refuses to give up, even at the cost of his own life.",

        "description": "Shino Aburame is character who has a fascination with bugs; most of his spare time is spent watching bugs, he often makes analogies to bugs when talking. In addition to liking bugs, Shino is characterized by his emotionless, solitary, and collected way of doing things. He speaks very bluntly and never allows emotion to interfere with his judgment, sometimes offending people in doing so. Despite his odd personality and occasionally arguing with Kiba, Shino has a very strong sense of connection with his teammates and allies.",

Shibi, like all members of his clan, has his eyes obscured by dark glasses which feature a single tassel hanging down from one-side. He has very spiky short black hair and a moustache. He typically wears a high collared outfit, while carrying a gourd on his back that is used for holding more kikaichū. He also tends to keep his hands in his pockets a lot, another trait he and his son share.",
